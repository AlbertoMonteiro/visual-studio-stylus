Stylus Dumb Syntax Highlighting for Visual Studio
=================================================

This is a copy of the CSS is Less tool which asigns the styl extension for Stylus CSS to the CSS editor.

You should just be able to install the extension, restart Visual Studio and be able to open .styl files and see them coloured like CSS.

It's not perfect and the colours go off when you nest but it's better than plain text so I hope this is useful.
